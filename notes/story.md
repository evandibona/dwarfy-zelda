Alright, the first story to be told with this engine, should be
designed after the Navassa event. 

People have been peaceably occupying an island for years. 
Not living there all the time, but using it as a place to harvest
shellfish for food and guano for fertilizer. 

Then in 1859, the US Exec Branch decides that it wants this island.
So, using a precedent set only a few years prior, makes a claim. 

---

In this case, there will be 8 to 21 inhabitants of this island. 
Each a hand-crafted character. 

After a short time, a lone US govt rep will arrive on the island with
the news that they have acquired this island and will be taking control. 
The inhabitants have 2 weeks to gather their belongings. 
Everyone will be guided off of the island at that time, if not,
they will be forcibly imprisoned. Failing that, violence may be used.
