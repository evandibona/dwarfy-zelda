Hmm What is necessary as far as physics go?

Collisions with objects, no matter how simple. 
  * If possible, collisions could have some bounce. 
  * Damage if it's an extreme collision. 
  * Certain objects would break upon high speeds.

Overall, until version 1 is accomplished, the physics should 
remain no more complicated than a typical GBA RPG.
