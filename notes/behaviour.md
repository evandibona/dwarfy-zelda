Obviously in real life behaviour is never entirely predicted by one's 
personality. 

However, en masse, people's behaviours can be predicted quite well. 
The more restricted the parameters, and the more accurate the model. 

I'm quite certain, as an example, that the first 10 minutes of gameplay for 
any basic rpg goes very similarly for every player. 

The personality of an individual determines his actions, *when all else
is equal.*

So one's personality can persuade or dissuade his actions. 

 > 1/(4x+0.4)-0.225

This is the equation to use, if the probability isn't where I want it to be. 
otherwise, math.abs(n/100)
