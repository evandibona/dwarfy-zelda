## Development Roadmap

### Version 0.01

Map in place. Generated from bitmap, allows quick level creation. 

### Version 0.1

All of the characters can run around like little critters. 
Do a handful of tasks each day in accordance with their traits, 
and take care of themselves, keeping their levels in check. 

### Version 0.1 to 0.5

All the building blocks for the final game are in place. 

  * Stories: objects that are passed around
  * Memories, some emotional response to connections to objects, names, people.
  * Fire
  * Guns, basic combat
  * Kidnapping
  * Risk Assessment. Present/Future Pain, Present/Future Pleasure

### Version 0.751 to 1

Interiors
  * Cannot be used until out-of-sight state is handled.
Value Assessment
  * each character will value objects, in a unique way. 

### Version 1

This may not be a very enjoyable game, but it should be complete. 
You will play as a simple warrior in a small, 2d open world. 
If you read the instructions and follow the proper hero's journey, 
you will be successful in bringing freedom back to your village. 
While also providing resources for them to prosper like never before. 

But, you can follow that plan, as much or as little as you want to. 

  * Each character's behaviour is dictated by:
    * Skill set
    * Big 5 Personality
    * Maslow's Hierarchy
    * Natural Laws of Justice
    * Tasks, Goals, Objectives
