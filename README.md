## Development Roadmap

### Version 0.01

### Version 0.5

All the building blocks for the final game are in place. 

### Version 1

This may not be a very enjoyable game, but it should be complete. 
You will play as a simple warrior in a small, 2d open world. 
If you read the instructions and follow the proper hero's journey, 
you will be successful in bringing freedom back to your village. 
While also providing resources for them to prosper like never before. 

But, you can follow that plan, as much or as little as you want to. 

  * Each character's behaviour is dictated by:
    * Skill set
    * Big 5 Personality
    * Maslow's Hierarchy
    * Natural Laws of Justice
    * Tasks, Goals, Objectives
